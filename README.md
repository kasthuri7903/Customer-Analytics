# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📜 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing user behavior data to test various hypotheses and gain insights into factors influencing product browsing and purchases. The dataset includes information on user age, browsing time, purchases, and other variables.

## 🔍 Hypotheses

1. **Hypothesis 1: Age Affects Browsing Time and Purchases** 🧓👵
   - Analyzed the relationship between age groups, browsing time, and total purchases.
   - Found varying browsing times and purchase patterns across different age groups.

2. **Hypothesis 2: Longer Browsing Time Leads to More Purchases** ⏱️🛒
   - Investigated the correlation between browsing time and the number of purchases.
   - Discovered a general negative correlation between browsing time and purchases, with some exceptions for younger age groups.

3. **Hypothesis 3: High Page Views Don’t Translate into Purchases** 📄➡️💵
   - Examined the correlation between total pages viewed and total purchases.
   - Found a very weak positive correlation, suggesting that high page views do not significantly impact purchases.

4. **Hypothesis 4: Browsing Too Long Leads to Fewer Purchases ("Choice Overload")** 🕰️❌🛒
   - Segmented browsing times into short, medium, and long categories.
   - Observed that longer browsing times were associated with more purchases, contradicting the "choice overload" hypothesis.

5. **Hypothesis 5: Customers from Certain Regions Purchase Less** 🌍💰
   - Analyzed total purchases by location.
   - Found variation in purchase amounts across different locations, with some regions having lower average purchases.

6. **Hypothesis 6: Device Type Influences Purchases** 💻📱📊
   - Compared average purchases by device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).
   - Noted differences in purchase amounts across device types, with mobile users having the highest average purchases.

7. **Hypothesis 7: Competitive Pressure in Certain Regions Leads to Fewer Purchases** 🌐💼📉
   - Investigated the relationship between browsing time, purchases, and location.
   - Found that regions with higher browsing times did not necessarily have lower purchases, challenging the idea of competitive pressure leading to fewer purchases.

## 📈 Analysis and Results

- **Age Groups**: Different age groups showed distinct patterns in browsing time and purchases.
- **Browsing Time and Purchases**: There was a negative correlation between browsing time and purchases overall, but with notable exceptions.
- **Page Views**: A weak correlation between page views and purchases indicated that high page views don't directly translate into more purchases.
- **Browsing Segments**: Longer browsing times were generally associated with more purchases, countering the choice overload hypothesis.
- **Regional Purchases**: Significant variation in purchase amounts by location was observed.
- **Device Type**: Mobile users had the highest average purchases compared to desktop and tablet users.
- **Competitive Pressure**: Regions with higher browsing times did not necessarily have fewer purchases.

## 🚀 Conclusion

The project provides insights into how age, browsing time, page views, location, device type, and competitive pressure influence user behavior. While some hypotheses were supported, others were contradicted by the data.
